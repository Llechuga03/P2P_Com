Basic P2P System, that handles secure message delivery using TCP and basic encode/decode functions. This system is meant to serve as a chat service for users, showing real time messages between users.
In future updates to the repo you can expect to see, a dedicated web application to host the chat system, and a database that stores user information. Note that because this is a P2P system,
only 10 users can be interacting with the system at once in order to prevent a denial of service attack.
